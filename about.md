My name is Michael Graeme Short and I am a locum optometrist and married father-of-three.

On the side, I learn about computer science and software development. I am also a [CMP](https://collegeofmediaandpublishing.co.uk/)-accredited proofreader and editor.

In my free time I enjoy staying fit, playing guitar and reading widely.
