My name is Michael Graeme Short and I am a locum optometrist and married father-of-two.

On the side, I learn about software development. I am also a [CMP](https://collegeofmediaandpublishing.co.uk/)-accredited proofreader and editor (not currently practising, but open to offers).

In my free time I enjoy going working out, playing guitar and reading conspiracy literature.
